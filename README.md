## Why Does This Exist? 
Many services offer a single-page-landing. These "web portals" have existed for decades before [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/), [About.Me](https://about.me), [Card](https://carrd.co/), etc.

There are too many services to choose from. Each one has minor differences, and benefits with premium paid upgrades.
